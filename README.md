# Jan Saarthi

Digital Independence for Informed Democracy

[Live Demo](https://vote-verify-hackathon.vercel.app/)

## Overview
Jan Saarthi empowers voters with clean, verifiable, and comparable candidate data. It turns complex affidavits into a modern, mobile-friendly experience with AI summaries and rich visualizations.

The Problem: A Crisis of Trust
In August 2025, the national conversation was dominated by the "vote chori" (vote theft) controversy, exposing what the Supreme Court has called a "trust deficit" in our electoral process. Voters are caught between high-profile political allegations and complex, scattered data, making it nearly impossible to form an independent, fact-based opinion. **This is not a political problem; it's an information problem.**


Built for the IIMB BBA(DBE) Vibecoding Hackathon (Independence Day Edition) under the theme: "Digital Independence - Innovating for a Better Tomorrow."
